# Modeling Memory Setup Instructions

This assignment uses **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive coding and exploration.  
You will run everything **locally** on your machine.

---

## 1. Install `uv`

We will use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to install and run Python tools for this assignment.

### macOS / Linux
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Windows
```
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
```

## 2. Launch Jupyter Notebook
From the root of the repository, run:
```
uv run --with jupyter jupyter notebook a1-student.ipynb
```
A browser window should open automatically- this is where you will be working.
If it doesn’t pop up, copy the URL printed in the terminal into your browser.

## 3. Submission
Once you are done, submit "a1-student.ipynb" to Gradescope!
